## Creates used in this project

1. [ndarray](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray)

It is a library for working with N-dimensional arrays that provides extensive array operations and optimized data access. It supports parallel operations and can be useful for HPC.

2. [rayon](https://crates.io/crates/rayon)

It allows you to conveniently perform parallel computations based on a declarative approach, which simplifies work with multi-core systems.

3. [tch](https://crates.io/crates/tch)

PyTorch is a library for working with neural networks and deep learning. Thanks to tch-rs, you can use PyTorch functionality together with the Rust language and work efficiently with large amounts of data.

4. [ocl](https://crates.io/crates/ocl)

Rust implementation of the OpenCL API. Provides: a simple and intuitive interface to OpenCL devices, the full functionality and power of the OpenCL API, an absolute minimum of boilerplate, zero or virtually zero performance overhead, thread-safe and automatic management of API pointers and resources.
